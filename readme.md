We were told repeatedly assignments would not be collected, as such the hero assignment is not 100% complete. Once I understood the concepts I moved on to my own study project, the flappy bird platform jumber style JavaScript game which I included as well to show I was not just sitting around during our work time. The game was functional to allowing the platoforms to fall from the top of the window to the bottom but I broke it during our lesson trying to work on it inbetween lectures but I believe you can still see what I was trying to accomplish. I will be working on this project through the week and should be able to finish it by friday.
